This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.(1)
Five prediction models are perfomed in this project to make prediction for the target value.
List of Utlized Machine Learning models: 1-Logistic Regression2-LDA 3-QDA 4- KNN 5- Random Forest.
Three of predictors play significant role in making prediction: BMI/Age/Glucose.
Random Forest performs best with 78% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity and 86.62% specificity.
